### Hi there 👋 I'm Arnold

- 🔭 I’m currently working on implementing the simple version of tools I rely on.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to reproduce GPT.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on AI+EDU | **G**enerative**UI** projects.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I prefer IOI over 101 because it is visually cuter and has stricter symmetry.
